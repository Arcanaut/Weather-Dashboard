  ## Description
  An app that allows the user to view the forecast for a city
  ## Features
  The user can look up a city to find its temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. This is not just limited to the day the user searches for the city; the app also gives a five(5) day forecast.

  In addition there is a search history that allows users to switch between recent searches, and the ability to clear the history if needed.


  ## Installation 
  No installations required, only the ability to view in a browser (that isn't Internet Explorer.)
  

  ## Usage
 Type in the search bar the name of the city followed by a comma with a state/country/region (e.g. Denton, Texas) and then click on the `search` button. To clear search history, click on the 'clear history' button
